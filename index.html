<!-- <p>PhD Candidate, Northwestern University Department of Economics</p> -->
<p>I am a PhD candidate in economics at Northwestern University. My research interests include macroeconomics, computational methods, and time-series econometrics. Please see my <a href="/research/research_page.html" target="_blank">research page</a> for more info on my projects or my <a href="Evan_Majic_CV_W25.pdf" target="_blank">CV</a> for a summary of my work and background. </p>

<p>My <a href="/teaching/teaching_page.html" target="_blank">teaching page</a> contains materials I've put together for my students, including notes, slides, and code. It's important to me that everything is both clear and thorough, so feedback is always welcome.</p>

<p>Outside of my academic research, I'm interested in forecasting. Every year, during the NCAA Basketball Championships, I do some simple modelling to try to make up for my woeful skill at making brackets. More recent forecasts can be found on my <a href="/mm/mm_page.html" target="_blank">March Madness page</a>. </p>

<p>I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:majic@u.northwestern.edu">majic@u.northwestern.edu</a>. My programs, if not posted on this site, may appear on my <a href = "https://github.com/evanmajic" target="_blank">my GitHub</a>.</p>
