<h1>"book" club</h1>
  <h2>how does it work?</h2>
  <p>this is designed to be a low-commitment way to read some (non-econ) stuff and have fun doing so.
  we read 1 or 2 stories a week picked by the group (current suggestions in the list section) and discuss them each [DAY/TIME TBD].
  we read something new every week so feel free to join in when you can! no start-up costs! just read, show up, and enjoy!</p>
